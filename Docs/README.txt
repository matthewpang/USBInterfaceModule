1) Via tenting on 4 vias. Tented Vias are on the rightmost side of the rightmost board design between the two rows of 12 SMD pads. Holes are 5mil diameter. Please try to assure full coverage of these vias.

2) Please route as per mechanical layer. We want a clean smooth edge throughout the two routing paths on panelized.gm1. We not do NOT want any breakway tabs - please adjust router toolpath accordingly to ensure full routing :)

3) Please V Score/Groove remaining edges as per mechanical layer panelized.gm1. 

Thanks a bunch :) Have a great day :)
